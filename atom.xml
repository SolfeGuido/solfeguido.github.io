<h1 id="solfeguido-2-0-is-now-available-on-the-play-store">SolfeGuido 2.0 is now available on the play store !</h1>

<p>SolfeGuido is now available on the play store at the following adress :
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.solfeguido2" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.solfeguido2</a></p>

<p>As stated in the previous post, this version is a complete rewrite in kotlin + libgdx.</p>

<p>I decided to release this version as a separate app for several reasons :</p>

<ul>
<li>The save files are not compatible from one version to another, and creating a converter would have taken too much time.</li>
<li>The style is quite different from one app to the other. And I still quite like the simplicity of the first version</li>
<li>I like the idea of having the &ldquo;original&rdquo; app still bein available instead of just forgetting about it, and erasing everything about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that&rsquo;s all for now, enjoy !</p>

<ul>
<li>Big package size (3MB of native libs)</li>
<li>Lack of locale detection</li>
<li>Lack of HTTPS support</li>
<li>Lack of strong typing in lua</li>
<li>Does not seem to crash correctly on android</li>
<li>All the UI must be created from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>After a little bit of research and testing, I finally decided to rewrite SolfeGuido using <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">LigGdx</a> with Kotlin as the programming language.
Let&rsquo;s see point by point how this frameworks solves every flaws of löve2D:</p>

<ul>
<li>The empty android .adb is only 1MB, which is 3 times less than löve2D (and I don&rsquo;t care about the build size for desktop)</li>
<li>Good support for i18n and an <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Internationalization-and-Localization" target="_blank">out of the box translation system</a></li>
<li>Https support thanks to the JRE</li>
<li>Really good typings, non-nullable types and more in Kotlin</li>
<li>Crash is reported on the google play</li>
<li>A really powerfull widget bundle that comes with animation support, styling, &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of all these existing features, it takes time to learn how to use them properly, but when you know how to use them, you can work quite fast on the app.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will be a good choice for the future, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes !</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the 1.4 release, I&rsquo;m quite happy with the state of SolfeGuido.
Of course, a lot of features I want to implement are missing. I still want to add a lot of other gamemodes, if possible also add new translations, new options and so on &hellip;
However, I encountered several limitations of love2d (the current game engine used for SolfeGuido) :</p>

<ul>
<li>The package size for a basic hello world is more than 3 MBytes. For game as small as SolfeGuido, that&rsquo;s twice the size of the assets !</li>
<li>Love2D/Lua is not really good at detecting the phone&rsquo;s locale. One could ask the user, but I&rsquo;d rather have it selected by default, and let the user change it later on</li>
<li>There is no HTTPS module in Löve2d, it seems like it&rsquo;s going to be added in a future version, but other game engine already have this feature</li>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s based on a scripting language (which is also a strength) it&rsquo;s quite easy to make a mistake and only realize this way later (or even too late), a compiled (or even transpiled) language could help reduce the risk of error</li>
<li>When the game crashes, a lovely screen can be shown on android, but this does not report anything to the play store, and it&rsquo;s then quite impossible to know if any crashes happened</li>
<li>Also, (but this is more my fault), the widget system is not very well coded, and could use a complete rewrite.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I&rsquo;m now pausing the development of SolfeGuido, while searching for a new game engine that meet all the required criterias !</p>

<p>Onward to SolfeGuido 2.0 !!</p>
